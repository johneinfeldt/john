Hi! I am John, a graduate student at MIT, engaged in coursework in finance, mathematics, and statistics. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, where I majored in Finance and graduated in the top 5% of my cohort. I was placed on the Dean's List and received a four-year merit scholarship in recognition of academic excellence. Through courses such as Trading & Sales, Applied Research, Financial Markets, and Corporate Finance, I developed a growing interest in more quantitative and computationally complex problems, a passion that led me to MIT’s Master of Finance program.

Quantitative finance aligns closely with the kind of problems I enjoy: fast-paced, thought-provoking, and situated at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and political developments. This page brings together my work and research to offer a first impression of what I find compelling about the field.

In addition, it includes a selection of my current and recent readings, starting in July 2025. They cover topics like political economy, philosophy and, somewhat unexpectedly, neuroscience, which I had once considered studying as an undergrad and was fortunate to explore durther during a semester abroad at Harvard (and plan to continue during my time at MIT). While I also read sources like the WSJ, FT, Economist, and similiar publications, they aren’t listed here.
